---

### Requirements

- Unity 6000 or later
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS builds)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) (for iOS builds)
- Android SDK (for Android builds)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Getting the SDK">
    <Card title="Get Playtolia Unity SDK" icon="download" href="https://github.com/Playtolia/unity-sdk/releases/download/v1.1.2/PlaytoliaSDK-112.unitypackage">
      Latest release (1.1.2)
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Importing to Unity">
    Drag and drop the downloaded .unitypackage file into your Unity editor. Make sure all folders are selected when Unity asks you to choose the folders to be imported into your project.

    <Warning>
      Make sure you import all folders including Plugins, Scripts, and Prefabs. Missing any folder may cause compilation errors or missing functionality.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creating a Playtolia Game Object">
    Add the PlaytoliaGameObject to your initial scene to initialize Playtolia components.

    #### Quick setup

    Simply drag and drop the PlaytoliaGameObject prefab (located at `Assets/PlaytoliaSDK/Prefabs/PlaytoliaGameObject.prefab`) to your main scene.

    #### Manual setup

    You can create your own PlaytoliaGameObject for customization. **Make sure that GameObject name matches "PlaytoliaGameObject" exactly.**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a new game object">
        Go to your scene and create an empty game object at the root by right clicking in your scene hierarchy and selecting GameObject \> Create Empty.

        <Warning>
          The GameObject must be named "PlaytoliaGameObject" exactly (case-sensitive) to ensure Playtolia Core can send messages to the correct GameObject.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add PlaytoliaGameObject script">
        Click on your new game object, and use the inspector to add PlaytoliaGameObject script as a new component.

        The PlaytoliaGameObject script handles:

        - SDK initialization on scene start
        - Message routing between native code and Unity
        - State management for all Playtolia components
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Playtolia">
    Navigate to **Edit \> Project Settings \> Playtolia Settings** to access the configuration panel.

    ### Essential Configuration

    **Game ID:** Your unique game identifier from the Playtolia dashboard. This is required for all API calls.

    **Logging Level:** Control SDK logging verbosity:

    - **None:** No logging (recommended for production)
    - **Error:** Only error messages
    - **Warning:** Errors and warnings
    - **Info:** General information (recommended for development)
    - **Debug:** Detailed debugging information

    ### Component Configuration

    **Authentication:** Enable to use login/logout features

    - **Authentication Required:** If enabled, login dialog appears automatically
    - **Providers:** Enable Google, Facebook, Apple, Discord, and Guest authentication

    **Billing:** Enable for in-app purchases and store functionality

    - Requires Authentication to be enabled
    - Includes Wallet, Store, and Entitlements APIs

    **Ticketing:** Enable for in-game customer support system

    <Warning>
      Always test your configuration in Development environment before switching to Production.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Platform-specific setup">
    ### iOS Setup

    1. **Cocoapods Installation:** Ensure Cocoapods is installed on your Mac

    ```bash
    sudo gem install cocoapods
    ```

    2. **iOS Deployment Target:** Set minimum iOS version to 12.0 or higher in Unity Player Settings
    3. **Add iOS Entitlements:** Enable this option in Playtolia Settings if using Sign in with Apple

    ### Android Setup

    1. **Minimum API Level:** Set to API level 21 (Android 5.0) or higher
    2. **Target API Level:** Use the latest available API level
    3. **Internet Permission:** Automatically added to AndroidManifest.xml
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verifying Your Setup

Create a simple test scene with the PlaytoliaGameObject and build to your target platform.

```c# TestPlaytolia.cs
using PlaytoliaSDK.Runtime;
using UnityEngine;

public class TestPlaytolia : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Check authentication state
        var authState = PlaytoliaAuth.GetState();
        Debug.Log($"Auth state: {(authState != null ? "Authenticated" : "Not authenticated")}");

        // Note: Store items, wallets, and entitlements will be empty until after authentication
        if (authState != null)
        {
            var storeItems = PlaytoliaStore.GetItems();
            Debug.Log($"Store items available: {storeItems.Count}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Issues

**Build Errors:**

- "PlaytoliaGameObject script not found" → Ensure you imported all folders from the Unity package
- iOS build fails with Cocoapods errors → Update Cocoapods and ensure Xcode command line tools are installed
- Android build fails with permission errors → Check that Unity Android settings allow internet access

**Runtime Issues:**

- "Game ID not configured" error → Set your Game ID in Project Settings \> Playtolia Settings
- Authentication always returns null → Ensure Authentication is enabled and you're connected to the internet
- Store/Wallet/Entitlements return empty → These APIs only return data after successful authentication
