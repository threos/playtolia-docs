### Requirements

- Playtolia SDK (with Authentication enabled)

### Sessions API

Playtolia Sessions API is the main access point for user-related information. Using Sessions API you can get user IDs, name, email, and locale. Just like other components, Sessions are managed with a Stateful object: PlaytoliaSession. PlaytoliaSession listens to changes in the auth state to automatically update user information.

If the player has not signed in or logged out, state will be `null`

### Getting the current session

Import the PlaytoliaSDK.Runtime to your script by adding the using directive

```c# ProfileMenu.cs
using PlaytoliaSDK.Runtime;
```

Call the **GetUser** function to get the current user session

```c# ProfileMenu.cs
User user = PlaytoliaSession.GetUser();
if(user == null) return; // user is not logged in

string email = user.Email;
string uid = user.Uid;
string playerId = user.PlayerId;
string username = user.Username; 
```

### Listen to user state changes

During the runtime, PlaytoliaSession state might change several times due to:

- **Authentication updates:** login, log out, token refresh
- **Updates to user:** Changing username, adding avatar, etc.
- **Manual refresh** via PlaytoliaSession.Refresh()

In order to make sure your game logic and UI stays up-to-date you can add listeners to PlaytoliaSession, just like with any other stateful component.

```c# ProfileMenu.cs
public void Start()
{
	PlaytoliaSession.AddListener(() => {
		User user = PlaytoliaSession.GetUser();
		if(user == null) return;

		username = user.Username; 
	});
}
```

### Need to save custom user properties?

Use the new Attributes API to save custom properties (such as level and flairs) to player profile and synchronize between devices.
