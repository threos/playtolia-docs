description: "Use Sessions API to access user information such as username, email, and player ID."
title: "Account Management"

### Requirements

- Playtolia SDK (with Authentication enabled)

### Sessions API

Playtolia Sessions API is the main access point for user-related information. Using Sessions API you can get user IDs, name, email, and locale. Just like other components, Sessions are managed with a Stateful object: PlaytoliaSession. PlaytoliaSession listens to changes in the auth state to automatically update user information. 

If the player has not signed in or logged out, state will be `null`
