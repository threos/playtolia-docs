### Requirements

- Playtolia SDK (with Authentication enabled)

### Authentication strategies

#### If you have "Authentication Required" enabled

Playtolia will display a login dialog as soon as the PlaytoliaGameObject you've placed in your scene becomes active.

<Warning>
  This authentication strategy doesn't require further manual setup. However, most of the time asking your players to login as soon as the game starts is not great for user experience.

  We recommend using **PlaytoliaAuth** APIs to customize when and where the login prompt will appear.
</Warning>

#### If you have disabled "Authentication Required"

You might want to display a trailer, display a demo level, or simply ask for login as after your player has progressed in the game. In that case you must disable the "Authentication Required" checkbox from your Playtolia Settings (in the [project settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html)) and prompt login manually.

PlaytoliaAuth.cs is a high-level wrapper to interact with auth related components. You can use PlaytoliaAuth.cs to prompt login, retrieve user session or listen to authentication state changes.

### Prompting login

Import the PlaytoliaSDK.Runtime to your script by adding the using directive

```c# LoginButton.cs
using PlaytoliaSDK.Runtime;
```

Call the **PromptLogin** function inside another function. Pass a boolean value to specify if the login dialog will be dismissable.

```c# LoginButton.cs
public void PromptLoginNonDismissable()
{
	PlaytoliaAuth.PromptLogin(false);
}

public void PromptLoginDismissable()
{
	PlaytoliaAuth.PromptLogin(); // or PlaytoliaAuth.PromptLogin(true);
}
```

If you prompt a dismissable login, the player can tap on the scrim (background) or close button on the dialog to cancel the login.

If you prompt a non-dismissable login, Playtolia will prevent the player from closing the login dialog. This also blocks the player from interacting with the game scene (dialogs block the touch interaction with your scene).

### Getting the auth state

AuthState is a simple object that holds access token, refresh token, and expiration info. In order to get the AuthState from your C# code, you can use **GetState** function.

```c# AuthHelper.cs
public bool IsUserLoggedIn()
{
	return PlaytoliaAuth.GetState() != null;
}

public string GetAccessToken()
{
	return PlaytoliaAuth.GetState().AccessToken;
}
```

### Listening to changes

AuthState is a simple object that holds access token, refresh token, and expiration info. In order to get the AuthState from your C# code, you can use **GetState** function.

```c# UIMenu.cs
public void Start()
{
	PlaytoliaAuth.AddListener(() => {
		var state = PlaytoliaAuth.GetState();
		var isLoggedIn = state != null;
		// Set LoginMenu gameobject active, if the user is not signed in.
		LoginMenu.SetActive(!isLoggedIn); 
	});
}
```

Listening to changes in the auth state is very useful since player session may expire. The listener functions you've added will be called after any auth state change (including logins and token refresh). This is specifically useful to know when your player has logged in, to update the UI.

### Need more information about the player?

Use PlaytoliaSession to get current user and see more information including email, username, player ID, and more.
