## How does it work?

Playtolia is a powerful SDK designed to help you build, monetize, and grow your games. We provide a comprehensive set of services that can be easily integrated into your Unity projects, including authentication, in-game purchases, virtual currencies, player profiles, and support systems.

### Playtolia Core

The core of Playtolia is the Playtolia.Core library, which provides the essential functionality for your game. Playtolia.Core is a cross-platform native library that can be used within Android and iOS applications.

**Platform-specific Implementation:**
- **iOS:** Native Objective-C/Swift library that integrates directly with iOS frameworks
- **Android:** Native Android library with JNI bindings
- **Unity:** A C# wrapper provides Unity-specific APIs while maintaining full native performance

### Playtolia for Unity

Playtolia.Unity is a Unity package that automatically integrates the Playtolia.Core library into your Unity project. Once installed, it will automatically add necessary dependencies and configure your project to use Playtolia services.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Integration:** No manual configuration of native dependencies required
- **Cross-platform:** Single codebase works on both iOS and Android
- **Event-driven:** Real-time state updates through listener patterns
- **Thread-safe:** All operations handle threading automatically

<Note>
  During runtime, Playtolia.Unity acts as a **bridge** between your Unity scene, C# scripts, and the Playtolia.Core library. All data is only available after successful authentication.
</Note>

## Core Components

### Authentication System

Supports multiple login providers with automatic token refresh and secure session management:

- Google (OAuth 2.0)
- Facebook (Facebook Login)
- Apple (Sign in with Apple)
- Discord (OAuth 2.0)
- Email/Password
- Anonymous/Guest mode

```c# AuthenticationExample.cs
PlaytoliaAuth.AddListener(() => {
    var authState = PlaytoliaAuth.GetState();
    bool isLoggedIn = authState != null;

    if (isLoggedIn) {
        Debug.Log("User is authenticated!");
        LoadPlayerData();
    } else {
        Debug.Log("User needs to log in");
        ShowLoginUI();
    }
});
```

### Billing and Monetization

Complete monetization solution with support for Apple App Store and Google Play Store:

- **Consumables:** Items that can be purchased multiple times
- **Non-consumables:** Permanent purchases
- **Subscriptions:** Recurring payments with automatic renewal handling
- **Virtual Economy:** Multi-currency wallet system with real-time balance updates

```c# MonetizationExample.cs
public void PurchaseGoldPack()
{
    var goldPack = PlaytoliaStore.GetItemById("gold_pack_500");

    var onSuccess = (Packet p) => {
        Debug.Log("Purchase successful!");
        PlaytoliaWallet.Refresh();
    };

    var onError = (Packet p) => {
        Debug.Log("Purchase failed: " + ((SDKResult)p.Data).Message);
    };

    var handle = EventBus.Register(onSuccess, onError);
    PlaytoliaStore.BeginPurchaseFlow(goldPack, handle);
}
```

### Player Management

Comprehensive player profile and session management with unique player identification across devices, username and email management, and locale detection.

```c# PlayerManagementExample.cs
PlaytoliaSession.AddListener(() => {
    User user = PlaytoliaSession.GetUser();

    if (user != null) {
        welcomeText.text = $"Welcome back, {user.Username}!";
        playerIdText.text = $"Player ID: {user.PlayerId}";
        ApplyLocalization(user.Lang);
    }
});
```
