## How does it work?

Playtolia is a powerful SDK designed to help you build, monetize, and grow your games. We provide a comprehensive set of services that can be easily integrated into your Unity projects. This includes features like authentication, in-game purchases, virtual currencies, player profiles, analytics, ticketing, and more.

### Playtolia Core

The core of Playtolia is the Playtolia.Core library, which provides the essential functionality for your game. Playtolia.Core is a cross-platform native library that can be used within Android and iOS applications. It provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with Playtolia services seamlessly.

**Platform-specific Implementation:**
- **iOS:** Playtolia.Core is compiled as a native Objective-C/Swift library that integrates directly with iOS frameworks
- **Android:** The library is compiled for the Java Virtual Machine as a native Android library with JNI bindings
- **Unity:** A C# wrapper provides Unity-specific APIs while maintaining full native performance

This architecture ensures that Playtolia can be used seamlessly across different platforms regardless of the underlying technology, while maintaining optimal performance and native platform integration.

### Playtolia for Unity

Playtolia.Unity is a Unity package that automatically integrates the Playtolia.Core library into your Unity project. Once installed, Playtolia.Unity will automatically add necessary dependencies and configure your project to use Playtolia services.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Integration:** No manual configuration of native dependencies required
- **Cross-platform:** Single codebase works on both iOS and Android
- **Performance Optimized:** Native code execution with minimal Unity overhead
- **Event-driven:** Real-time state updates through listener patterns
- **Thread-safe:** All operations handle threading automatically

This package provides a set of Unity-specific APIs that allow you to use our services in a way that is familiar to Unity developers, with full IntelliSense support and comprehensive documentation.

<Note>
  During runtime, Playtolia.Unity acts as a **bridge** between your Unity **scene, C# scripts, and the Playtolia.Core** library. Playtolia.Unity is the **wrapper** that allows you to use Playtolia services in your Unity project without having to worry about Java references, Objective-C bridges, or native libraries.

## Core Components

### Authentication System

Playtolia provides a comprehensive authentication system that supports multiple login providers:

**Supported Providers:**
- Google (OAuth 2.0)
- Facebook (Facebook Login)
- Apple (Sign in with Apple)
- Discord (OAuth 2.0)
- Email/Password (Traditional authentication)
- Anonymous/Guest mode

**Features:**
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure session management
- Cross-device synchronization
- Offline capability with cached credentials

```c# AuthenticationExample.cs
// Simple authentication example
PlaytoliaAuth.AddListener(() => {
    var authState = PlaytoliaAuth.GetState();
    bool isLoggedIn = authState != null;

    if (isLoggedIn) {
        Debug.Log("User is authenticated!");
        LoadPlayerData();
    } else {
        Debug.Log("User needs to log in");
        ShowLoginUI();
    }
});
```

### Billing and Monetization

Complete monetization solution with support for all major app stores:

**Store Integration:**
- Apple App Store (iOS)
- Google Play Store (Android)
- Server-side receipt validation
- Fraud protection and security

**Purchase Types:**
- **Consumables:** Items that can be purchased multiple times (coins, gems, energy)
- **Non-consumables:** Permanent purchases (premium upgrades, character unlocks)
- **Subscriptions:** Recurring payments with automatic renewal handling

**Virtual Economy:**
- Multi-currency wallet system
- Real-time balance updates
- Transaction history and analytics
- Entitlement management for premium features

```c# MonetizationExample.cs
// Purchase flow example
public void PurchaseGoldPack()
{
    var goldPack = PlaytoliaStore.GetItemById("gold_pack_500");

    var onSuccess = (Packet p) => {
        Debug.Log("Purchase successful!");
        ShowRewardAnimation();
        PlaytoliaWallet.Refresh(); // Update balances
    };

    var onError = (Packet p) => {
        Debug.Log("Purchase failed: " + ((SDKResult)p.Data).Message);
        ShowErrorDialog();
    };

    var handle = EventBus.Register(onSuccess, onError);
    PlaytoliaStore.BeginPurchaseFlow(goldPack, handle);
}
```

### Player Management

Comprehensive player profile and session management:

**User Profiles:**
- Unique player identification across devices
- Username and email management
- Avatar and profile customization
- Account creation and update timestamps
- Locale and timezone detection

**Session Management:**
- Automatic session restoration
- Cross-device data synchronization
- Secure token handling
- Logout and cleanup procedures

```c# PlayerManagementExample.cs
// Player profile example
PlaytoliaSession.AddListener(() => {
    User user = PlaytoliaSession.GetUser();

    if (user != null) {
        welcomeText.text = $"Welcome back, {user.Username}!";
        playerIdText.text = $"Player ID: {user.PlayerId}";

        // Customize experience based on user locale
        ApplyLocalization(user.Lang);
    }
});
```

## Architecture Deep Dive

### State Management Pattern

Playtolia uses a reactive state management pattern that ensures your game UI stays synchronized with player data:

**Stateful Components:**
- `PlaytoliaAuth` - Authentication state
- `PlaytoliaSession` - User profile data
- `PlaytoliaStore` - Available store items
- `PlaytoliaWallet` - Currency balances
- `PlaytoliaEntitlements` - Purchased items and subscriptions

**Event-driven Updates:**
```c# StateManagementExample.cs
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Listen to all state changes
        PlaytoliaAuth.AddListener(OnAuthChanged);
        PlaytoliaWallet.AddListener(OnWalletChanged);
        PlaytoliaEntitlements.AddListener(OnEntitlementsChanged);
    }

    void OnAuthChanged()
    {
        // Update UI based on authentication state
        UpdateLoginButton();
    }

    void OnWalletChanged()
    {
        // Update currency displays
        UpdateCurrencyUI();
    }

    void OnEntitlementsChanged()
    {
        // Enable/disable premium features
        UpdatePremiumFeatures();
    }
}
```

### Network Architecture

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Critical operations (authentication, purchases) go through secure servers
- Non-critical data (leaderboards, social features) can use cached responses
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Offline mode support for core functionality

**Security Features:**
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Server-side validation for all transactions
- Anti-fraud protection and anomaly detection
- GDPR and privacy compliance built-in

public class PlaytoliaTest : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Testing Tools")]
    public bool enableVerboseLogging = true;
    public bool simulateNetworkErrors = false;

    void Start()
    {
        if (enableVerboseLogging)
        {
            // Enable detailed logging for debugging
            Debug.Log("Playtolia Test Mode Enabled");
        }

        // Test all major components
        StartCoroutine(TestAllComponents());
    }

    IEnumerator TestAllComponents()
    {
        yield return TestAuthentication();
