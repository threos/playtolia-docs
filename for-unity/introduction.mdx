## How does it work?

Playtolia is a powerful SDK designed to help you build, monetize, and grow your games.\
We provide a set of services that can be easily integrated into your Unity projects.\
This includes features like authentication, in-game purchases, analytics, ticketing, and more.

### Playtolia Core

The core of Playtolia is the Playtolia.Core library, which provides the essential functionality for your game.\
\
Playtolia.Core is a cross-platform library that can be used within Android and iOS applications.\
It provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with Playtolia services.

For iOS, Playtolia.Core is compiled as a native library. For Android, the library is compiled for Java Virtual Machine just like a regular Java library.\
\
This ensures that Playtolia can be used seamlessly across different platforms regardless of the underlying technology.

### Playtolia for Unity

Playtolia.Unity is an Unity package that automatically integrates the Playtolia.Core library into your Unity project.

Once installed, Playtolia.Unity will automatically add necessary dependencies and configure your project to use Playtolia services.\
\
This package provides a set of Unity-specific APIs that allow you to use our services in a way that is familiar to Unity developers.

<Note>
  During runtime, Playtolia.Unity acts as a **bridge** between your Unity **scene, C# scripts, and the Playtolia.Core** library. Playtolia.Unity is the **wrapper** that allows you to use Playtolia services in your Unity project without having to worry about Java references or native libraries.
