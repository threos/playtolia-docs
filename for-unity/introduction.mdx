## How does it work?

Playtolia is a powerful SDK designed to help you build, monetize, and grow your games.\
We provide a set of services that can be easily integrated into your Unity projects.\
This includes features like authentication, in-game purchases, analytics, ticketing, and more.

### Playtolia Core

The core of Playtolia is the Playtolia.Core library, which provides the essential functionality for your game.\
\
Playtolia.Core is a cross-platform library that can be used within Android and iOS applications.\
It provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with Playtolia services.

For iOS, Playtolia.Core is implemented as a native library and for Android, it is compiled to Java.\
This ensures that Playtolia can be used seamlessly across different platforms regardless of the underlying technology.

### Playtolia for Unity

Playtolia.Unity is a Unity package that automatically integrates the Playtolia.Core library into your Unity project.

Once installed, Playtolia.Unity will automatically add necessary dependencies and configure your project to use Playtolia services.\
\
This package provides a set of Unity-specific APIs that allow you to use our services in a way that is familiar to Unity developers.

<Note>
  During runtime, Playtolia.Unity acts as a **bridge** between your Unity **scene, C# scripts, and the Playtolia.Core** library. Playtolia.Unity is the **wrapper** that allows you to use Playtolia services in your Unity project without having to worry about Java references or native libraries.
